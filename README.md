# Follow Your Trainer
Inspired by the defunct Pokestats.live, using Pokedata.ovh data as source, you can use this application to follow trainers playing in Play! Pokémon tournaments.

## Motivation
I have been trying to be competitive in the Pokémon TCG tournaments nationally and internationally, but I couldn't track my results live easily. This was a time when [https://labs.limitlesstcg.com](https://labs.limitlesstcg.com) and [Pokerank](https://pokerank.gg) didn't exist. So I decided to do a small app to get the data from [Pokedata](https://pokedata.ovh) and allow user registration to track your own results and people you follow.

## Technologies
This allowed me to expand my knowledge a little bit and try new technologies. At first, I tried to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), but costs and limits were ramping, so I decided to migrate to a PHP server. But the frontend was done in Next.js, so that I could try to learn more.

I did use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) by myself for the first time (they have a really good free plan, that fit my needs) and Google SSO in the backend.

## Shutdown of the project
The project was shutdown on summer of 2025, when the World Championship ended. I had a little bit of backlog in this application, with some bugs here and there and I couldn't dedicate the time that it needed. I am very proud of this app, from its inception until its end.
